            <h1>A little about me</h1>

            <p>
                My name is Lucas. I'm a 29 year old guy living in the city of Uppsala, a little bit north of Stockholm,
                Sweden, together with my partner and our two cats. <br>
                We both work in the airline industry, where I mostly do e-commerce analysis and software development
                planning.
            </p>

            <p>
                I decided to learn programming as it is a nice way of getting instant feedback and short-term validation
                by solving mini-puzzles. I reckon I will mostly enjoy building different models, functions and other
                neat things you can do, as I enjoy automatization.
            </p>

            <p>
                Three important things about me:
            <ol>
                <li>I love cats</li>
                <li>I love asian stuff, especially the food</li>
                <li>Video games are great</li>
            </ol>
            </p>

            <p>
                There is a great quote from one of my favorite books, the Wheel of Time series by Robert Jordan, and it
                goes like this:
            <blockquote>
                “You can never know everything, and part of what you know is always wrong. Perhaps even the most
                important part. A portion of wisdom lies in knowing that. A portion of courage lies in going on
                anyways.”<br>
                <cite> - The Eye of the World</cite>
            </blockquote>
